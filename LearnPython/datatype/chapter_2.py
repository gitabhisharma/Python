#  This chapter to learn a basic Numreical datadype and it's operations

# Numbers in Python are of three types:
# 1. int (Integer)

# Let's see an example of integer
ice_cream = 10
raper_count = 5
total_ice_cream = ice_cream + raper_count
print(f"The total ice cream is {total_ice_cream}")

cup_tea = 20 
number_cup = 4
# The caculate the remender of cup tea
total_cup_tea = cup_tea - number_cup
# And print a total cup tea
print(f"The total cup tea is {total_cup_tea}")

# 2. float (Floating Point)

# Let's see an example of float
price_of_ice_cream = 50.5
price_of_raper = 20.5
# Calculate the total price 
total_price = price_of_ice_cream + price_of_raper

# And print the total price
print(f"The total price is {total_price}")

# 3. complex (Complex Numbers)

# Let's see an example of complex number
a = 2 + 3j
b = 5 + 6j
# Calculate the total of complex number
total_complex = a + b
# And print the total complex number
print(f"The total complex number is {total_complex}")
