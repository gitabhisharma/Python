# Write a program to division of two numbers and print the resut

# let's difine the two varibales 
a = 10 
b = 3

# Calculate the division on a and b varibales 
c = a / b 
#  Print the result 
print(f"The division of a and b is: {c}")

# We can also do floor division in python
d = a // b
print(f"The floor division of a and b is: {d}")

# We can also do modulus division in python
e = a % b
print(f"The modulus division of a and b is: {e}")
