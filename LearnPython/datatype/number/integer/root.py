# Write a program to calculate the root squre of a numbers

# Let's difine a variable
a = 16 
# Calculate the root squre of a variable
b = a / 2 * 0.5
# Print the result
print(f"The root squre of a is: {b}")


#  And calculate the squre of a given numbers
b = 6 
c = 5  
#  Calculate the squre of b and c
d = b ** 2 
e = c ** 2
# Print the result
print(f"The squre of b is: {d} and squre of c is: {e}")
