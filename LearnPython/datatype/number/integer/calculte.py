# Write program to build a simple caluclator using a two numbers?

# Let's difine a variables 
a = 4
b = 5

# Calculate the all math opperations of a and b 
c = a + b
d = a - b
e = a * b 
f = a / b
g = a // b 
h = a % b 
i = a ** b 
# Print the all math opperations value
print(f"The additions of a and b is: {c}.\nThe substraction of a and b is: {d}.\nThe multiplication of a and b is: {e}.\nThe division of a and b is: {f}.\nThe floor division of a and b is: {g}.\nThe modulus division of a and b is: {h}.\nThe squre of a to the power b is: {i}.")
# Note: You can also print the result in a single line using \n for new line.
